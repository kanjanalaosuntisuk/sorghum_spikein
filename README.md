This is a repository of data and scripts used in the manuscript "A normalization method that controls for total RNA abundance affects the identification of differentially expressed genes, revealing bias toward morning-expressed responses".

Data used in the analysis are in the 'RData' folder, and R scripts are in the 'scripts' folder.

Scripts
- BTx_gene_count_table.R: for filtering genes with low number of read counts
- BTx_spike_count_table.R: for analyzing external RNA spike-in read counts
